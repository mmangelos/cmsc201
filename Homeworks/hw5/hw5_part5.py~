# Description: This program gets words from a user and then prints them in
#              reverse order, as well as the words being backwards.

def main():

    # gets the amount of words the user wants
    wordCount = int(input("Plese enter how many words you want backwards: "))
    wordList = []
    count = 1
    while len(wordList) != wordCount:
        toAdd = input("Please enter string #" + str(count) + ": ")
        wordList.append(toAdd)
        count += 1

    #prints all words backwards
    count = len(wordList) - 1
    while count >= 0:
        print("The string '" + wordList[count] + "' reversed is '" + \
              backwards(wordList[count]) + "'.")
        count -= 1
